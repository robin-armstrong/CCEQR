This package provides `cceqr!`, a Julia implementation of the "collect, commit, expand" column-pivoted QR factorization. To install this package, run the following commands in a Julia terminal:
```
import Pkg
Pkg.install("https://github.com/robin-armstrong/CCEQR.git")

After this, run `using CCEQR` to bring `cceqr!` into the namespace. Running `?cceqr!` will show detailed documentation for the function.
