cceqr!(A; k = minimum(size(A)), rho = 1e-4, full = false)

Compute the first `k` entries of the column permutation for a CPQR factorization
of `A`, modifying `A` in place. Use a "collect, commit, expand" strategy with block
proportion `rho`. If `full == true`, then apply Householder reflections to all
columns yielding a complete `R` factor. Returns the column permutation, the number of
cycles used, the average pivoting block size per cycle, and the final size of the tracked set.
